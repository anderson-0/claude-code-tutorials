## Overview

The CLAUDE.md file is the single most impactful thing you can do to make Claude Code effective on your project. It's a markdown file that lives in your project root and teaches Claude about your specific codebase.

## Why CLAUDE.md Matters

When Claude Code starts a session in your project, it automatically reads CLAUDE.md if it exists. This gives Claude immediate context about:

- Your project's architecture and structure
- Coding conventions and style guidelines
- Available commands (build, test, lint, deploy)
- Important files and directories
- Common patterns and anti-patterns

Without CLAUDE.md, Claude has to discover all of this by reading files and asking questions. With a good CLAUDE.md, Claude can be productive immediately.

## Using /init

The fastest way to create a CLAUDE.md is to let Claude generate one for you:

```bash
claude
> /init
```

Claude will analyze your project structure, read key files, and generate a starting CLAUDE.md. You can then refine it.

## CLAUDE.md Structure

A well-structured CLAUDE.md typically includes these sections:

### Project Overview

```markdown
# Project Name

Brief description of what the project does and its main purpose.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL
- Infrastructure: Docker, AWS
```

### Directory Structure

```markdown
## Directory Structure

- `src/` — Main source code
  - `components/` — Reusable React components
  - `pages/` — Next.js pages
  - `lib/` — Utility functions and shared logic
  - `api/` — API route handlers
- `tests/` — Test files (mirrors src/ structure)
- `docs/` — Documentation
```

### Commands

```markdown
## Commands

- `npm run dev` — Start development server
- `npm run build` — Build for production
- `npm run test` — Run test suite
- `npm run lint` — Run ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` — Run TypeScript compiler
```

### Conventions

```markdown
## Conventions

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Components use PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
- Utilities use camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
- Tests are colocated with source files (`*.test.ts`)
- Use `async/await` over `.then()` chains
```

## Best Practices

### Keep It Focused

Your CLAUDE.md should be scannable. Aim for 100-300 lines. If it's too long, Claude might miss important details.

### Include "Do" and "Don't" Lists

```markdown
## Guidelines

### Do
- Run tests before committing
- Use conventional commits
- Add JSDoc comments to public functions

### Don't
- Commit directly to main
- Use `any` type without justification
- Leave TODO comments in production code
```

### Document API Patterns

If your project has APIs, document the patterns:

```markdown
## API Conventions

All API routes follow this pattern:

- `GET /api/[resource]` — List resources
- `POST /api/[resource]` — Create resource
- `GET /api/[resource]/[id]` — Get single resource
- `PUT /api/[resource]/[id]` — Update resource
- `DELETE /api/[resource]/[id]` — Delete resource

Error responses use this format:
\`\`\`json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Human-readable message"
  }
}
\`\`\`
```

## Subdirectory CLAUDE.md Files

For large projects, you can create CLAUDE.md files in subdirectories. Claude will read the most specific one for the files it's working with.

```
project/
├── CLAUDE.md           # Project-wide context
├── frontend/
│   └── CLAUDE.md       # Frontend-specific context
└── backend/
    └── CLAUDE.md       # Backend-specific context
```

## Iterating on Your CLAUDE.md

Your CLAUDE.md should evolve with your project. After working with Claude Code:

1. Notice when Claude makes mistakes or asks obvious questions
2. Add clarifying information to CLAUDE.md
3. Remove outdated information
4. Add new patterns as they emerge
