## Overview

This tutorial takes you from zero to your first productive Claude Code session. By the end, you'll have Claude Code installed, understand how it differs from chat-based AI, and be comfortable giving it real tasks in your terminal or IDE.

## What Is Claude Code?

Claude Code is an **agentic coding tool** that lives in your terminal. Unlike chat-based AI (where you copy-paste code back and forth), Claude Code can directly read your files, run shell commands, edit code across multiple files, and execute your test suite — all while you watch and approve.

### The Mental Model Shift

Think of it this way: chatting with Claude on claude.ai is like texting a brilliant colleague who can only see what you paste into the conversation. Claude Code is like that same colleague sitting next to you, looking at your screen, with their hands on a second keyboard.

### Key Capabilities

Claude Code can do things a chat-based AI simply cannot:

- **Read your entire codebase** — it navigates files, follows imports, understands your architecture
- **Edit files directly** — no more copy-pasting; it writes changes into your actual source files
- **Run shell commands** — it executes your build, test, lint, and any other tool
- **See and fix errors** — when a command fails, it reads the output and adapts
- **Work across multiple files** — a single task can touch routes, models, tests, and docs simultaneously
- **Manage Git** — it stages changes, writes commit messages, creates branches, opens PRs

## Installation

Claude Code can be installed several ways depending on your operating system.

### macOS

**Option A: Native Install (Recommended)**

The native installer auto-updates in the background, so you're always on the latest version.

```bash
# Download and run the installer
curl -fsSL https://cli.claude.ai/install.sh | sh

# Verify installation
claude --version
```

**Option B: Homebrew**

If you prefer Homebrew, note that it does **not** auto-update.

```bash
brew install claude-code

# Verify
claude --version
```

### Linux

```bash
# Download and run the installer
curl -fsSL https://cli.claude.ai/install.sh | sh

# Verify installation
claude --version
```

### Windows

**Prerequisites**: Windows requires **Git for Windows** installed first.

**Option A: WinGet**

```powershell
winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode

# Verify
claude --version
```

**Option B: Native Installer**

```powershell
# In PowerShell
irm https://cli.claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Authentication

The first time you run `claude`, you'll be prompted to log in. You need one of:

- A Claude Pro, Team, or Enterprise subscription (claude.ai)
- An Anthropic Console API account with credits

```bash
# Start Claude Code — it will open a browser for authentication
claude
```

## Your First Session

Let's run Claude Code for real. Open your terminal, navigate to any project directory (or create one), and start a session.

```bash
# Create a test directory
mkdir claude-test && cd claude-test

# Start Claude Code
claude
```

You'll see Claude Code's interactive prompt. It's waiting for your instruction. Let's start with something simple:

```text
> What files are in this directory? Give me a summary of the project structure.
```

### Try These Starter Prompts

Each of these demonstrates a different capability:

1. **"Create a simple Python script that prints 'Hello from Claude Code'"** — Claude creates a file directly in your directory

2. **"Read the file you just created and add error handling"** — Claude reads, understands, and edits existing files

3. **"Run the script and show me the output"** — Claude executes shell commands

4. **"Initialize a git repo and commit what we have"** — Claude manages Git operations

## Core Concepts

### Sessions and Context

Each time you run `claude`, you start a **session**. A session is a continuous conversation with Claude that has memory of everything discussed.

Key things about sessions:

- Sessions persist until you exit (Ctrl+C or type /exit)
- Claude can read files and run commands throughout the session
- Each session has a context window — a limit on how much information Claude can hold
- When context fills up, Claude automatically compacts (summarizes) the conversation
- You can resume previous sessions with `/resume` or `claude --resume`

### Tools — What Claude Code Can Do

Under the hood, Claude Code has a set of **tools** it can use:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Read` | Read file contents from your project |
| `Write` | Create or overwrite files |
| `Edit` | Make targeted edits to specific parts of files |
| `Bash` | Execute shell commands (build, test, lint, git, etc.) |
| `Glob` | Find files matching a pattern |
| `Grep` | Search for text across your codebase |

You don't need to tell Claude which tool to use. Describe what you want, and Claude picks the right tools.

### Checkpoints and /rewind

Every time Claude edits a file, it automatically creates a **checkpoint** — a snapshot of your code at that moment. If Claude takes a wrong turn, you can rewind:

```text
# Press Esc twice quickly to rewind the last change
# Or use the /rewind command for more control:
/rewind
```

## Essential Slash Commands

Claude Code has built-in slash commands you can run at any time during a session:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show all available commands and keyboard shortcuts |
| `/status` | Check your current model, account, and session info |
| `/model` | Switch between models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) |
| `/resume` | Resume a previous session or switch sessions |
| `/rewind` | Rewind to a previous checkpoint |
| `/init` | Auto-generate a CLAUDE.md file for your project |
| `/compact` | Manually summarize the conversation to free up context |
| `/exit` | End the current session (or press Ctrl+C) |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Esc (x2)` | Rewind the last Claude action |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel current operation or exit |
| `Ctrl+R` | Search prompt history |
| `Ctrl+T` | Toggle task list visibility |

## The Permission Model

Claude Code operates on a **trust but verify** principle. It always asks before doing something that could change your system.

### Permission Levels

1. **Read-only (Always allowed)** — Reading files, searching code, listing directories
2. **File modifications (Asks permission)** — Creating, editing, or deleting files
3. **Shell commands (Asks permission)** — Running any terminal command

### Responding to Permission Prompts

When Claude asks for permission, you have several options:

```text
Claude wants to run: npm test

Options:
  y     — Yes, allow this once
  n     — No, deny this
  a     — Always allow this command for this session
  e     — Edit the command before running
  !     — Skip and continue without running
```

## What's Next

You now have Claude Code installed and you've experienced the fundamental loop: describe what you want → Claude reads, edits, runs → you approve.

In the next tutorial, you'll learn to write a **CLAUDE.md** file — the single most impactful thing you can do to make Claude Code effective on your project.
