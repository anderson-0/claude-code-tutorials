## Overview

How you communicate with Claude Code dramatically affects the quality of results. This tutorial covers prompting strategies for common scenarios.

## The Anatomy of a Good Prompt

A good prompt typically includes:

1. **Context** — What Claude needs to know
2. **Task** — What you want Claude to do
3. **Constraints** — Any limitations or requirements
4. **Output format** — How you want the result

### Example: Feature Implementation

**Weak prompt:**
```text
> Add authentication to the app
```

**Strong prompt:**
```text
> Add JWT-based authentication to our Express API.
>
> Requirements:
> - Use the existing User model in src/models/user.ts
> - Store tokens in httpOnly cookies
> - Add /auth/login and /auth/logout endpoints
> - Protect all /api routes with auth middleware
>
> After implementing, run the tests to verify.
```

## Prompting Patterns

### The Exploration Pattern

When you're not sure what needs to be done:

```text
> I'm seeing a bug where users can't log in on Safari.
> First, help me understand the authentication flow by tracing
> from the login button click to the server response.
> Don't fix anything yet — just explain what's happening.
```

### The Step-by-Step Pattern

For complex tasks, break them down:

```text
> We're going to add a shopping cart feature. Let's do this in steps:
>
> Step 1: Create the cart data model
> Step 2: Add API endpoints for cart operations
> Step 3: Build the React components
> Step 4: Wire up the frontend to the API
> Step 5: Add tests
>
> Start with step 1 and wait for my approval before each next step.
```

### The Test-First Pattern

Ensure quality by leading with tests:

```text
> Before implementing the email notification feature:
> 1. Write integration tests for the expected behavior
> 2. Show me the tests and wait for approval
> 3. Then implement the feature to make tests pass
```

### The Refactoring Pattern

For safe refactoring:

```text
> Refactor the UserService class to use dependency injection.
>
> Constraints:
> - Keep the public API exactly the same
> - Run tests after each change to ensure nothing breaks
> - Commit after each successful refactor step
```

## Context Management

### Providing File Context

Instead of letting Claude search, point it directly:

```text
> Look at src/components/Dashboard.tsx and src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts.
> The analytics hook is causing unnecessary re-renders.
> Explain why and fix it.
```

### Building on Previous Work

Reference what Claude has already done:

```text
> In the auth middleware you just created, add rate limiting.
> Use the same pattern we used for the API routes.
```

### Resetting Context

When starting a new task:

```text
> Let's start fresh. Forget about the authentication work.
> Now I need help with the payment integration.
```

## Handling Complexity

### The "Explain First" Approach

For unfamiliar codebases:

```text
> I'm new to this project. Before making any changes:
> 1. Explain the overall architecture
> 2. Identify the key abstractions
> 3. Note any patterns I should follow
```

### The "Options" Approach

When multiple solutions exist:

```text
> I need to add real-time updates to the dashboard.
> Give me 3 different approaches (WebSockets, SSE, polling)
> with pros/cons for each. Don't implement yet.
```

### The "Verification" Approach

For critical changes:

```text
> Before making this database migration, answer:
> 1. Is this migration reversible?
> 2. Will it cause downtime?
> 3. What's the rollback plan?
>
> Only proceed if you can confirm all safeguards.
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Too Vague

```text
> Make it better
```
This gives Claude no direction. Be specific about what "better" means.

### Too Detailed

```text
> Create a function called processUser that takes a parameter
> called user of type User and returns a ProcessedUser by
> calling the validateUser function and then the transformUser
> function and then...
```
If you're writing the code in English, you might as well write the code.

### Micromanaging

```text
> First open the file, then go to line 42, then...
```
Tell Claude *what* you want, not *how* to use its tools.
